    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I want you to think about the last time you wanted to buy some donuts. Did you ever get the feeling that you really didn’t want to go down to the bakery or the store to order it? Think about it... have you ever thought about just ordering them online and having them delivered right to your door? Well, you’re in luck, because that’s something that I can do for you! I have created a company and platform that provides an incredibly accessible service for individuals of ages 18 and up to be able to order donuts from the peace and comfort of their home, or anywhere they may be. My platform is easy to use and very convenient as well, making it the #1 online option for guaranteed customer satisfaction!</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is not any particular age group, but realistically it will most likely be anyone between the ages of 10-65. The reason for this is because while whitewater rafting is fun, it is a lot of physical excercise and can also be potentially harmful to small children, as well as most people over the age of 65. WHile these age groups are not ruled out, they just are much less likely to my purchasing my products and services, so they are not a particular focus for me. In addition, the location of my customers is also a big focus for me. Since I am located on the Fork River in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, I want to prioritize the needs of the customers that are located within a 100-mile radius of my company's location. On my website, I want people to know exactly where I am located on a map and how easily navigate there. I would also like for my customers to be able to make purchases on my website quickly and easily, so that they can have the best experiences with my brand and services. I plan on keeping my website very accessible to anyone who might be interested in not only rafting, but also outdoors activities in general. I think these additions to my website will accomplish my goal of inviting the kind of people I want to my website. Once the website is complete, my target audience will be able to access my website not only on their desktop or laptop, but also their mobile devices as well, so that everyone can have accessibility to my website and my business.</p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
