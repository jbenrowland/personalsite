    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I want you to think about the last time you wanted to buy some donuts. Did you ever get the feeling that you really didn’t want to go down to the bakery or the store to order it? Think about it... have you ever thought about just ordering them online and having them delivered right to your door? Well, you’re in luck, because that’s something that I can do for you! I have created a company and platform that provides an incredibly accessible service for individuals of ages 18 and up to be able to order donuts from the peace and comfort of their home, or anywhere they may be. My platform is easy to use and very convenient as well, making it the #1 online option for guaranteed customer satisfaction!</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience for this website is not necessarily a particular age group, but it will be a group that enjoys donuts and sweets in general. Since donuts are not a very expensive market, my products will be available to everyone regardless of age or financial situation. When individuals come to my website, I expect that they are there to view my products and to make purchases. In addition, our goal is to be able to appeal to all ages, because doughtnuts are a creation that should be enjoyed by all. I plan on keeping my website fairly colorful and fun as well as easily accessible, so that I can appeal to the broadest audience possible. I think these additions to my website will accomplish my goal of inviting the kind of people I want to my website. Once the website is complete, my target audience will be able to access my website not only on their desktop or laptop, but also their mobile devices as well.</p>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/cdb4db-ffc8dd-ffafcc-bde0fe-a2d2ff"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/cdb4db-ffc8dd-ffafcc-bde0fe-a2d2ff</a>
