                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <h3>My target audience for this website is not necessarily a particular age group, but a group of people that share the same passion for all different types of donuts and sweets in general. Since donuts are not a very expensive market, my products will be available to everyone regardless of age or financial situation. When individuals come to my website, I expect that they are there to view my products and to make purchases, and the website is tailored to make purchases easy and secure. In addition, our goal is to be able to appeal to all ages, because doughtnuts are a creation that should be enjoyed by all. The plan for this website is to keep it fairly colorful and fun as well as easily accessible, so that I can appeal to the broadest audience possible. I think these additions will accomplish my goal of inviting the kind of people I want to purchase my products. Everyone is now able to access my website not only on their desktop or laptop, but also their mobile devices as well.</h3>
